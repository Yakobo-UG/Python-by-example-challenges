'''
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
On every year that is evenly divisible by 4 **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
'''

year = int(input("Enter the year: "))
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
                print("Leap Year !")
        else:
            print("Not a leap year !")
    else:
        print("Leap Year !")
else:
    print("Not a leap year !")
